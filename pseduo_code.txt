Delivery Algorithm:

For each truck, the basics:
1. Find the shortest distance from the hub to the first delivery.
2. Find the shortest distance from one delivery to the next.
3. Find the shortest distance from the last delivery back to the hub.

Restrictions:
- Some packages are delayed and wont arrive until a specified time.
    - Some of the delayed packages have a "deliver by" time that is less than 90 minutes after they've arrived.
- Some packages have a deliver by time that needs to be met.
- Some packages are going to the same address and should be delivered together at the same time.
